<p> <b>I am a 19 year old girl from Chicago Illinois. Chicago has many great attractions such as:</b></p> <ul><li>Lake Michigan</li><li> Navy Pier</li><li>The Willis Tower</li></ul>

<p> <b>My personal favorite palce in Chicago is Wrigley Field. Wrigley Field is home of America's favorite baseball team at the moment, the Chicago Cubs. I grew up going to cubs games with my dad and Wrigley Field brings back great memories for me. It's where I ate my first hot dog and cracked open my first bucket of peanuts. Wrigley field will always hold a special place in my heart, and it is so exciting to watch everyone cheer my favorite team on in the World Series. <i><span style="color:red;"> Congrats to the Cubs on their HUGE World Series Win!</span></i> </b> </p> 

<p> <b> Another great part about Chicago is the pizza! Chicago is known for their deep dish pizza, you can't et it anywhere else. And if you think you can I promise it's not as good. We have Lou Malnati's, Pizanos, and best of all, <i> <span style="color:red;"> Pequods.</span></i> Deep dish pizza is like nothing you've every tasted before. It gets better with every bite, and every time I go home it's the very first thing I eat.</b></p> 

<p> <b> Besides pizza and Wrigley Field, Lake Michigan is the next best part of Chicago. It may freeze over in the winter, but in the summer it is a fantastic attraction. You can go saling, or swimming, and all the beach fronts are tons of fun to be at. My personal favorite is Oak Street Beach. It is full of young people and is absolutely breath taking. They have tons of restaurant and ice cream stands along the shore and the sand is soft under your feet. It is my favroite palace to go with my friends from ho mea nd my favorite place to take my friends from college when they visit. If you can't tell, I love Chicago and I would highly suggest you go visit if you've never been there. Just make sure you go in the summer! </b> </p>
